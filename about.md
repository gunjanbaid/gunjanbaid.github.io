<br>

I am upcoming M.S. student at UC Berkeley in computer science. 
I completed my undergraduate study at UC Berkeley in December 2016 with a double major in computer science
and molecular and cell biology (biochemistry emphasis). I am interested in applying 
computational techniques to problems in biology. 

I am currently working on a research project with [Professor Nir Yosef](https://niryosef.wordpress.com/)
and leading a [student team](http://dataconnect.berkeley.edu/connector_associates.html) for UC Berkeley's 
Data Science Education Program. This fall, I will be at UC Berkeley for the 5th years M.S. program in Computer Science and will be advised by [Professor David Culler](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~culler/).

If you to talk, feel free to email me at <span class="rev">ude.yelekreb@diab_najnug</span>. You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gunjanbaid/).

## Research
# TRAPeS

![trapes](/assets/trapes.png)

[TRAPeS](https://github.com/YosefLab/TRAPeS) (TCR reconstruction algorithm for paired-end single cell) 
is a software created in [Professor Nir Yosef](https://niryosef.wordpress.com/)'s lab. The program can reconstruct
T-cell receptor sequences from RNA sequencing reads of various types. The 
original algorithm was designed for paired-end short reads (~30bp) from scRNA-seq data. 
I am working to extend the functionality of TRAPeS to single-end medium (~60bp) and long
(~100bp) reads and paired-end medium and long reads. The above image is from [this page](https://niryosef.wordpress.com/tools/).

## Teaching

I have been a student instructor for multiple courses at UC Berkeley.
You can find the results of my teaching evaluations 
[here](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/coursesurveys/instructor/8844). 
In 2016, I received an Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching Award 
from the Computer Science Division at Spring commencement.
In 2017, I received a [Campus Outstanding GSI Award](http://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/).

In the past year, I have been involved with the [Data Science education program](http://data.berkeley.edu/education). 
I will be speaking at [JupyterDays Philly](http://jupyterday.blogs.brynmawr.edu/) in May 2017 and 
[JupyterCon](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny) in August 2017 about [Data 8](http://data8.org) and the [connector courses](http://data8.org/connector) in the program.
