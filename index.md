I am an MS student in computer science at UC Berkeley. I completed my undergraduate study at UC Berkeley in December 2016 with a double major in computer science and molecular and cell biology (biochemistry emphasis). I am currently doing research with the [Big Data Genomics group](http://bdgenomics.org/) in [RISELab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu) and am advised by [Prof. Anthony Joseph](). I am also involved with the Data Science Education Program at UC Berkeley as a technical lead for connector courses.

# TRAPeS

![trapes](/assets/images/trapes.png)

TRAPeS is a software created in [Professor Nir Yosef's](https://niryosef.wordpress.com/)lab that is used to reconstruct T-cell receptor sequences from RNA sequencing reads of various types. The original algorithm was designed for paired-end short reads (~30bp) from scRNA-seq data. I am working to extend the functionality of TRAPeS to single-end medium (~60bp) and long (~100bp) reads and paired-end medium and long reads. The above image is from [this page](https://niryosef.wordpress.com/tools/).

## <a name="teaching"></a> Teaching and Data Science Education Program

I have been a student instructor for multiple courses at UC Berkeley.
You can find the results of my teaching evaluations 
[here](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/coursesurveys/instructor/8844). 
In 2016, I received an Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching Award 
from the Computer Science Division and Prof. David Culler at Spring commencement.
In 2017, I received a [Campus Outstanding GSI Award](http://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/).

For the past year, I have been a technical lead for the [Data Science education program](http://data.berkeley.edu/education). I spoke at [JupyterDayPhilly](http://jupyterday.blogs.brynmawr.edu/) in May 2017 and will be speaking at [JupyterCon](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny) in August 2017 about the pedagogy of [Data 8](http://data8.org) and the [connector courses](http://data8.org/connector) in the program.
