I am an engineer who is interested in applying machine learning to problems in health. This summer, I was a machine learning intern at [Bay Labs](http://baylabs.io/), where I worked on developing neural network models for the interpretation of cardiac ultrasound images. Prior to the internship, I was a student at UC Berkeley, where I received an M.S. in computer science and a B.A. in computer science and molecular and cell biology (biochemistry emphasis).

#### Research

While at Berkeley, I was part of the [Big Data Genomics](http://bdgenomics.org/) research group in [RISELab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu). My graduate research focused on transcription factor binding site prediction using deep learning: [An Attention-Based Model for Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2018/EECS-2018-83.html) (Master's thesis, advised by Prof. Anthony Joseph).

#### Teaching

I enjoy teaching and was a student instuctor for multiple couses (CS61A, CS88) in the UC Berkeley EECS department and the Division of Data Sciences. For my work, I was awared an Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching Award in 2016 and [Campus Outstanding GSI Award](http://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/) in 2017. I had the chance to speak about some of the educational infrastructure used by the undergraduate Data Science Education Program at [JupyterDayPhilly](http://jupyterday.blogs.brynmawr.edu/) in May 2017 and [JupyterCon](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny) in August 2017 ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmSHbdDKFGQ)).
